# Strands Agent Chatbot with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

An end-to-end reference architecture for building **agentic workflows** using  
**Strands Agents** and **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**.

This repository demonstrates how to design and deploy a multi-agent chatbot that combines
tool execution, memory, browser automation, and agent-to-agent collaboration.
It is intended as a realistic, extensible sample for teams exploring advanced agent architectures on AWS.

## Key Features

- Strands-based agent orchestration
- Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, Gateway, and Memory
- MCP Gateway tools (Google, Wikipedia, ArXiv, Yahoo Finance, Tavily, Open-Meteo)
- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) collaboration
- Built-in Code Interpreter for charts and documents
- Multimodal input and output (vision, charts, documents, screenshots)
- Real-time voice interaction with Amazon Nova Sonic 2

## Skill System (Progressive Disclosure)

Tools are organized into **skills** — grouped units with SKILL.md instructions that the agent loads on demand.
Instead of injecting all tool documentation into every prompt, the agent activates only the skills it needs:

1. **L1 Catalog** — Skill names and one-line descriptions (always in system prompt)
2. **L2 Instructions** — Full SKILL.md loaded via `skill_dispatcher` when activated
3. **L3 Execution** — Tool calls via `skill_executor`

This keeps prompt size small while giving the agent access to detailed instructions when needed.

## Multi-Protocol Tool Architecture

| Tool Category | Protocol | Examples | Authentication |
|--------------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Local Tools | Direct Python | Web Search, URL Fetcher, Visualization | None |
| Built-in Tools | AWS SDK / WebSocket | Code Interpreter, Browser (Nova Act) | IAM |
| Gateway Tools | MCP | Google Search, Maps, Wikipedia, ArXiv, Finance | SigV4 |
| Private API Tools | MCP (3LO OAuth) | Gmail, Google Calendar, Notion, GitHub | OAuth 2.0 |
| A2A Tools | A2A | Research Agent, Browser-Use Agent | SigV4 |

Total: **100+ tools across 20 tool groups**
See [docs/guides/TOOLS.md](docs/guides/TOOLS.md) for full details.

## Voice Mode

Real-time voice interaction using **Amazon Nova Sonic 2**, **Strands BidiAgent**,
and **AgentCore Runtime WebSocket**.

- Seamless switching between voice and text within a single session
- Shared conversation history across both modes
- Full tool execution support during voice conversations

---

## Memory Architecture and Long-Context Management

The system uses **AgentCore Memory** with:
- Short-term session memory
- Long-term summarized memory

Long conversations are compacted using a context summarization strategy to
retain key information while controlling token growth.

## Token Optimization via Prompt Caching

Prompt caching reduces input token usage by reusing system prompts, stable instruction blocks,
and repeated conversation context across agent loop iterations.

This project originally implemented caching via custom Strands hooks.
The approach has since been upstreamed into the Strands SDK as a built-in feature
([strands-agents/sdk-python#1438](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python/pull/1438)):

```python
from strands.models import BedrockModel, CacheConfig

model = BedrockModel(
    model_id="us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6-v1",
    cache_config=CacheConfig(strategy="auto")
)
```

---

## Multi-Agent Architecture

Agent-to-Agent communication is handled via the **A2A protocol**, allowing the supervisor agent to delegate tasks to specialized worker agents such as a deep research agent.
Multiple agents collaborating in sequence — each handling its own role — are coordinated using the **Swarm** pattern.
